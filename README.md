# Transfer learning for Random Forest
Implementation of the SER-STRUCT algorithm to perform Transfer Learning in Random Forest

The algorithm is presented on this paper:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.01258v2.pdf

Algorithm
-------------
There are many method for supervised learning in machine learning. The idea of transfer learning is to learn one of these method for source data and then modify it for the target data. For example we can use a method for activity recognition of healthy people and then with some changing, transfer the method for unhealthy people.

Installation

Implemenation
-------------
The code uses scikit-learn functions for making the random forest.
